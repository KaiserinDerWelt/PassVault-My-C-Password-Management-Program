					<h2>1. Creating Your PassVault Account</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                   	When you launch the program for the very first time, click on the "Sign Up" link and fill in the form fields to create your PassVault Account and your Database Account Login Information.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    NOTE - When you reach the Password Hint, please be sure to make it good and not so obvious because this will be shown immediately after filling out the "Forgot Password" form should you ever have to do so! This is for your own safety!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After you have created your PassVault account, enter the login information into the login window that first appeared when you launched the program. If you have accidentally closed it, just restart the program by double clicking on the shortcut icon.
                    <br>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class = "col12">
                	<h2>2. Connecting to Your Database</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    If you recall during the signup process, you were asked to fill in another page of information that is very much similar to the first one, which involves another username, and another password, as well a database name. Using this information, you will head on over to the menu bar at the top, and click on the "Edit" link, and then click on the "Preferences" option on the drop-down menu. A new window named "Preferences" should pop up. 
                    <br>
                    Now, if you look at the left column of the Preferences window, click on the link that is labeled "Connection". This is where you will be entering your database login information. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class = "col12">
                	<h2>3. Adding Your Data</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    To add your list of account information that you wish to store, just simply fill in the highlighted boxes displayed in the figure below, and once you've filled in the required form fields, simply click the "Add Account" button. You may have to press the "Update" button on the bottom to see the new changes take place.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class = "col12">
                	<a name = "faq"></a>
                	<h1 class = "topicTitle">FAQs - FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h1>

                <div class = "col12">
                	<ul>
                    	<li>How secure is my data?</li>
                        <p>
                        The program features AES 256 bit encryption, which is a government standard of encryption. So rest assured, your data is very safe.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <li>I forgot my login details for my PassVault account, what should I do?</li>
                        <p>
                        When you open the program, there is a "Forgot Password" link. Click on it and fill in your name and email, as well as the confirmation code that is displayed next to the input box. Click the submit button, and it will provide you your password hint, and a email of your password will be sent to your email account that you used during the sign up process. 
                        <br>
                        In worse cases, if you still can't figure out your password, and you don't have the ability to access the email address account stored in the PassVault account, feel free to contact us for further assistance. Be sure to provide as much information possible to prove your identity when you first signed up for the account. We will then access our databases and reply to you with your account information, and follow the instructions provided in the email reply.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <li>What happens if I delete my PassVault account?</li>
                        <p>
                        If you delete your PassVault account, the corresponding database information will also be deleted. So make sure to backup your information before deleting your account. Once you confirm the deletion of your account, there is no way for us to recover the deleted data.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <li>How do I export the information stored in my database quickly?</li>
                        <p>
                        At the top of your window, click "File", "Export as", "Excel Spreadsheet". Once you do that, depending on what program you have installed to view excel files, a excel spreadsheet window should pop up with all of your stored database's account information in it. Once this happens, be sure to save that excel spreadsheet to a safe location before you close the window.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <li>How random is the random password generator?</li>
                        <p>
                        The random password generator utilizes a XXX bit encryption and hashing algorithm to generate a 128 character long password. Depending on what the user enters for the character length, the generated 128 character password is then cut down to the desired character length. We recommend that you select the "a-z, A-Z, 0-9" option if the account you are trying to create the password for is case sensitive. The chances of a repetition happening is very very very low, depending on the character length you enter. The longer the length, the lower chances of reptition will be.
