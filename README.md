PassVault-My-C-Password-Management-Program
==========================================

This is a C# program I created to securely manage and store my account information on a local offline database. Other features will be added in future updates as well as fixes to current bugs I've noticed. The program features 256-bit AES encryption algorithm as well as multi-user interface for multiple user usage.
